**Q1.Why to use firewall?**
Ans:- A firewall is simply a filter that determines which network packets (i.e. data) can come in to your computer from the internet 
and which can leave your computer to the internet. 
It's mainly used to allow and/or disallow incoming connections. 
Outgoing connections are rarely filtered.

The only time you'd need a firewall is if you're running some kind of server application on your system. 
This could be a web server, email server, game server, etc. 
In this case, a firewall will restrict incoming connections to certain ports, making sure that they can only interact with the proper server application.

**Q2.How you can say a website is mallicious or not?**.

**There are some easy ways to tell if a website is attempting to install malware:**

    • The website asks you to download software, save a file, or run a program.
    • Visiting the website automatically launches a download window.
    • You are asked to download an invoice or receipt, such as a PDF file, .zip or .rar, or an executable file or .scr screensaver file.
    • Your computer is already infected with malware.
    • Your plug-ins or browser are out of date.
    • You have won a competition or free prize draw. You may also be offered free money or vouchers 
      that require you to enter your credit card or banking information.
      
  **Q3. What are the different kind of firewall?**

    1.packet filtering firewall
    2.circuit-level gateway
    3.application-level gateway (aka proxy firewall)
    4.stateful inspection firewall
    5.next-generation firewall (NGFW)
 
 **Q4.What are data packets?**
 Ans:- A packet is the fundamental unit of information transport in all modern computer networks, and increasingly in other communications networks as well.

Packets are transmitted over packet switched networks, which are networks in which each message (i.e., data that is transmitted), such as an e-mail, web page or program download, is cut up into a set small segments prior to transmission.

**Q5.Why do we use Sudo su?**
Ans:- The sudo command allows you to run programs as another user, by default the root user. If the user is granted with sudo assess, the su command is invoked as root.
The su command switches to the super user — or root user .
