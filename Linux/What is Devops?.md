    • Monolithic architecture us built as one large system and is usually one code-base

    • Large codebase  makes IDE slow and built time gets increase. 
    
  **Microservices
    
    • Microservices architecture is built as small independent module based on business functionality
    • It is easy to scale based on demand.
    • Each project and module has their own database
    • Each project is independent and small in size. So overall build and development time gets decrease.
